- [ ] Write the extra tests from the TODOs.
- [ ] Take a screenshot of the benefit.

- [ ] See if I can reconfigure with a new Selector.
- [ ] Obj passed in may be value, or object or array.
- [ ] Simplify the following TODO items and place them onto Github issues.
- [ ] Allow paths with square brackets, aka array/filter/group items:
      See: https://github.com/sebinsua/jstruct/commit/f8642c87dfb9dc39477e1d59eaa34d92bfc24a49#diff-ed741defd3ce45bbae8fb3a3c3532ac9R42
- [ ] Selector may contain a $key to pick up the key.
- [ ] Selector may return multiple values.
- [ ] Key may be a selector if it contains the separator.
- [ ] filters, key selectors, grouping???!!??
  sel(selector, [filterObject, ] transformFn)
  filter keys can be within the selector like [:filter-key].
  `[*]` is what it looks like. So is [prop].
- [ ] group by is magical. It looks like:
 "activities": {
   "person/interests[*]/type": "person/interests[$k]/name"}
- [ ] I want to be able to group by a path.
- [ ] I want to be able to execute functions which depend on multiple paths. E.g. b:filter(a.name===b.name) - possible solution: this is the context of the json structure, so a function can access paths from this.
- [ ] I want to be able to filter an array.
- [ ] I want to be able to filter an object.
- [ ] I want to be able to slice an array.
